## INTRODUCTION TO PHP

PHP is designed to interact with HTML to generate dynamic websites.
*  `<?php` and `?>` tags:  Embedding PHP in HTML
* Every statement in PHP must be terminated with a semicolon `;`
* PHP files have a **.php** extension.
    * The file always starts with the opening PHP tag `<?php`.
    * The closing tag is implied and left out by convention.
*  Whitespace is generally ignored when executing PHP code.
*  Keywords are not case sensitive in PHP. As a convention, use the standard casing.
* Comments in PHP:
    * Single line comments are made using `#` or `//`
    * Multi-line comments are placed between `/*` and `*/`
