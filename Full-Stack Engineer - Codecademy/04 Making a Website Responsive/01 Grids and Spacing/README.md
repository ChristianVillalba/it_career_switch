# GRIDS AND SPACING

Grids are made up of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines.        
The Grid systems help you organize your designs and provide a series of guidelines to properly align elements on a page.      
Grids can also promote consistency, allowing you to build repeated patterns to carry throughout your designs.

* The reasons we design using grids are:
  * Promote consistency within our designs
  * Properly align elements on our page
  * Provide ample spacing between content
* Remember a grid is made up of:
  * Columns
  * Gutters
  * Margins
*  Spacing is incredibly important within a design to ensure:
  * Elements have ample room to breathe
  * Denote emphasis on certain parts of a page
  * Promote harmonious patterns and rhythms within your designs
