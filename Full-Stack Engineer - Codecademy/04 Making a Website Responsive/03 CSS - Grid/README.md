# GRID ESSENTIALS

We can elegantly lay out elements on a web page using CSS.      
The **Box Model** and **Display & Positioning** explain some possible ways to style layout.

The grid can be used to layout entire web pages.
  * Flexbox is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout.
  * CSS grid is most useful for two-dimensional layouts

To turn an HTML element into a grid container: element’s `display` property:
  * `grid` — for a block-level grid.
  * `inline-grid` — for an inline grid.

We can assign other properties to lay out the grid to suit your needs:
* `grid-template-columns`
  * Define the columns of our grid
  * By default, grids contain only one column
  * We need to explicitly define the number of rows and columns in our grid.
* `grid-template-rows`
* `grid-template`
* `grid-template-area`
* `row-gap / column-gap / gap`
* `grid-row-start / grid-row-end`
* `grid-column-start / grid-column-end`
* `grid-area`
