# FLEXBOX

The flexbox is a tool that greatly simplifies how to position elements.     
There are twwo important components to a flexbox layout:
* Flex containers  
* Flex items.

A flex container is an element on a page that contains flex items.      
All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items.       
This distinction is important because some of the properties you will learn in this lesson apply to flex containers while others apply to flex items.      

To designate an element as a flex container:
* Set the elementâ€™s display property to flex or inline-flex.
* Once an item is a flex container, there are several properties we can use to specify how its children behave:
    * justify-content
    * align-items
    * flex-grow
    * flex-shrink
    * flex-basis
    * flex
    * flex-wrap
    * align-content
    * flex-direction
    * flex-flow
