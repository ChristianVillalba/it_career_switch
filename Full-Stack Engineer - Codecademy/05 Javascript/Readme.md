## Introduction to JS

* Data is printed, or logged, to the console, with `console.log()`
* Comments in JS
    * Single-line `//`
    * Multi-line comments between `/*` & `*/`
* There are 7 fundamental **data types** in JavaScript: 
    * Strings 
    * Numbers 
    * Booleans 
    * Null 
    * Undefined 
    * Symbol 
    * Object
* The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` (returns reminder in a division)
* **Objects**, including instances of data types, can have **properties**: stored information
    * The properties are denoted with a `.` after the *name of the object*
    * eg: `"Hello".length`
* **Objects**, including instances of data types, can have **methods**: perform actions
    * Methods are called by appending the object or instance with `.`, the *method name* & `()`
    * `'hello'.toUpperCase()`
* **Built-in objects**, including `Math`, are collections of **methods and properties** that JS provides


## Variables

* *ariables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.
* Variables are stored in memory.
* The `var` keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
* `let` is the preferred way to declare a variable when it **can be reassigned**
* `const` is the preferred way to declare a variable with a **constant value**
* Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type **undefined**.
* Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
* The `+` operator is used to **concatenate strings** including string values held in variables.
* **Template literals** (In ES6) use backticks \`\`\` and `${}` to interpolate values into a string.
* The `typeof` keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.
