# Express.js

* Express.js: Server-Side Frameworks 
    * **Framework:**  a collection of code to make it easier to accomplish a specific task
        * Developers must follow the rules and syntax put forth by the framework to use it properly
    * **Server-side framework:** used to run web applications and handle web development workflows on the server-side (back-end) 
        * eg: accessing databases, generating HTML, handling URL routing
    * A server-side framework can **handle** a lot of the **back-end responsibilities**
    * Other benefits:
        * Access to libraries built to work with the framework
        * Existing resources and documentation for solving common problems
        * Improved security

* Node.js and Express.js
    * You can create a back-end entirely with Node.js
    * The **Express.js framework** makes implementing some **core functionality** much quicker than doing it from scratch
