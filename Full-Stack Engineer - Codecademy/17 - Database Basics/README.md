# Database Basics

* **A database **is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured in a way that makes the data easily accessible.
* **A relational database** is a type of database. 
    * It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database.   
    * Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.
* **Tables**: Rows and Columns
    * Tables can also have many columns of data. Columns are labeled with a descriptive name (say, age for example) and have a specific data type.
* **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**
    * (RDBMS) is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database. 
    * Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database.
* **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
    * A programming language used to communicate with data stored in a relational database management system
    * Many RDBMSs use SQL (and variations of SQL) to access the data in tables.
