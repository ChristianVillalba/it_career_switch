# SECONDARY NAVIGATION

* The primary navigation system typically contains the most important links and buttons that need to be displayed on every single page of the site.
* Secondary navigation, or breadcrumb navigation, usually consists of a clickable list of pages or attributes that led to the current page.     
    * It can help users understand the extent of the site and
    * Where they are currently.

Using breadcrumbs as a secondary navigation method for a site:

* Use breadcrumbs to indicate where a user is and the extent of the site
*  Breadcrumbs are implemented using unordered lists in HTML with custom CSS styling
*  Three types of breadcrumbs exist:
    *  **location** - based on hierarchical structure of site
    *  **attribute** - based on attributes of current page or item
    *  **path** - unique to a userâ€™s journey on the site
        *  Path-based breadcrumbs can be confusing, only use if needed
*  Ensure breadcrumbs will add value before adding to a site
