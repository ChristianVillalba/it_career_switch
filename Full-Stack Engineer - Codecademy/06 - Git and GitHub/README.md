# Git & GitHub
---
## Git
* Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers
* Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
* `git init` creates a new Git repository
* `git status` inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
* `git add ` *filename*: adds files from the working directory to the staging area
* `git diff ` *filename*: shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
* `git commit -m "my message here"` permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
* `git log` shows a list of all previous commits
* `git checkout HEAD filename`: Discards changes in the working directory.
* `git reset HEAD filename`: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
* `git reset commit_SHA`: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.
    * SHA (commit's long code)
    * We only need to write the first 7 characters of the SHA
